Hiya,

My name is Vic Nagel (they/them), I will graduate from Sciences Po Paris in June 2024 within the School of Research - Sociology.

I am interested in sociology of health, of sexuality, and of social inequalities. I have written a dissertation titled "Not queer enough? Stigma within lesbian, gay and bisexual populations - A mixed-method study", supervised by Martin Aranguren.

I will present my research at the International Conference on Social Stress Research next June in Portland, OR, USA, as well as at the summer school for mixed methods.

You can find my CV in French [here](nagel-victoria-cv.pdf).
