Hiya,

My name is Vic Nagel, I will graduate from Sciences Po Paris in June 2024 within the School of Research - Sociology. I have written a dissertation titled "Not queer enough? Stigma within lesbian, gay and bisexual populations - A mixed-method study", supervised by Martin Aranguren.

I will present my research at the International Conference on Social Stress Research next June in Portland, OR, USA.

You can find my CV in French [here](nagel-victoria-cv.pdf).
